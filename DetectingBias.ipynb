            "Trump’s comments came at a time in which political discourse was at its busiest and his personal brand was starting to look increasingly like a presidential campaign. The   presidential primary season could be just beginning.   With the Democratic race now so close, the Trump campaign has been getting ready to start building its first presidential campaign around the next president. Trump’s message appears to have been delivered early on Tuesday in Washington, but the latest headlines are highlighting how the campaign is preparing to spend big money on advertising and staff, and how Trump plans to make sure to get his message through before his convention. While his comments may have hurt supporters, many of whom were critical, his message was a huge political success so far.                                                                                                         —   Clinton campaign officials plan    ads to appear throughout the campaign to remind people to call in to talk to people who may be upset with Trump. The ads will be paid for through social media. While Trump’s comments in the past could have caused a stir among voters, Clinton campaign spokesman John Podesta said Trump will need to “explain himself” before he’s expected to deliver a major speech. ”How he deals with the press is important,” Podesta pointed out. He said there was a point when he was just being asked to talk about political issues and he made sure to say that he’d speak to this issue at his rallies. He also said a lot of people might not be able to get to his rallies if they miss or can't be reached. The campaign is also looking for supporters to be on its best behavior to help sway a Trump victory. And while Podesta said there are “no guarantees that he will deliver a big speech,” he said he’ll look into a campaign plan and “go into things cautiously.”                                                                                                                   \n",

            " In an era of increasing paranoia and public outrage over mass media bias, a major Washington Post investigation reveals a      video, purportedly from the Trump campaign, is the source of a vast, unverified, and  . Video, purportedly from Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller’s phone just minutes before the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, was discovered Sunday by the paper’s reporter and now has been identified as a fake. It comes after months of leaks claiming the campaign, as a result of a leaked New York Times report, was trying to manipulate a leaked report by its reporters. The video, posted on Twitter early Sunday morning, begins with a clip of Trump himself speaking as Trump’s family watches on in Philadelphia. While much has changed in the last two weeks, a number of the same clips still remain true and circulated by Trump supporters. In addition, Trump and other Trump supporters have circulated an online database of   Trump supporters who have claimed, to varying degrees, that a video is the source of any of the claims Trump has made over the years. Some have even offered to pay to watch Trump’s speech at the convention, but it has always been unclear whether they also have a physical presence. However, it appeared in the latest edition of “The Trump Effect” released Monday morning. The video, which appears to be a modified version of an earlier,   video from the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was also on the bus, comes after several other claims of campaign manipulation and conspiracy theories surfaced over the weekend. The footage shows Trump supporters watching in Pennsylvania after their candidate, Hillary Clinton, was scheduled to speak at an Ohio rally. They are then seen taking a photo of Clinton near a polling place. It is not clear if the incident was part of a coordinated effort, the latest in a string of false claims. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, meanwhile, defended her team by saying it is focused on the Philadelphia and is “reaffirming the facts. ” Click for more from  .

            "A U. S. drone strike Monday, which killed four suspected militants suspected of using   suicide vests near the   village of Manna in southern Somalia, underscores the threat posed by extremist groups, an official with the U. S. International Security Assistance Force said Tuesday. A drone strike killed all four suspected militants suspected of using suicide vests at a military base in northern Somalia, according to the officials familiar with the attack, which also killed U. S. Special Operations forces and two civilians. The identities of the victims and their attackers were not immediately clear. One statement from the U. S. Mission in Somalia said the incident occurred on an outpost in southern Somalia. ”The mission can confirm with you that reports of this incident continue to be reported to the U. S. Embassy in Somalia, and to the other government of Kenya, the government of the United Arab Emirates and to the international community, that no government, or party, is responsible for the alleged acts of terrorism,” the statement said. U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry said at a press conference following the strikes, it was ”absolutely appropriate that we take appropriate military actions against them.” ”In the past, when we have known or suspected that an active   or an   would be involved, our security forces took action to prevent or to prevent the activities,” Kerry said. The drone strikes appeared to be the Pentagon’s first in Syria, but they had another effect in Afghanistan, where more than a dozen suspected militants were killed in December and January by U. S. troops, U. S. Central Command said. The senior military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the ongoing operations directly, said the U.

FBI Director James Comey said that the FBI has not made a determination as to whether the emails are classified at the time of the discovery, and that it is possible that some of the information is still being produced. “We remain hopeful that the material contained in the email is not only classified but also may still be available in the future,” Comey added.

China’s stock market tumbled after reports that the country’s central bank has raised interest rates, triggering a major run on stocks this year and putting the country’s stock market at risk. The Chinese economy also began weak in December and December was largely driven by the fact that U.

Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Lent said China’s stock markets have ”zeroed” since December, and that China’s   economy is moving through the nether regions. China has had a string of strong months, with the economy running at more than 2. 6 percent capacity, according to the International Monetary Fund. On January 5, a record high for U. S. domestic demand, 1. 9 million tons was added to the national inventory, according to IOM.  Meanwhile, China’s stock market has fallen to its lowest level yet, after hitting its highest level in December. In January, the Shanghai Composite shed 8. 5 percent after slipping 2 percent in the past two months. But market expectations for January are far higher and analysts believe the Shanghai Composite is nearing its   target, which means its bull market could hit 1, 500 points at some point this year, after falling for the past three years. A record high of 121. 7 billion yuan ($106. 5 billion) was outstanding on January’s stock market, an improvement from the 118. 6 billion yuan originally outstanding on January    a 7 percent increase and up from 122. 8 billion yuan in January, according to government data. Prices have fallen 1. 7 percent in the past two months.  Investors should see a big boost in   growth when the government completes its road map to tackle China’s economic and fiscal problems, according to a report from IHSMarkets Inc. The report says the number of new jobs created worldwide this year has added 1. 8 million jobs, driven in part by new investment by Chinese businesses in the United States and other emerging markets. China is spending $500 billion annually on defense and needs $11. 2 billion for a   budget, according to the report.\n",
            " A prominent American who fled his own country to join ISIS has been charged with terrorism charges for allegedly plotting with others to attack his homeland. Court documents for two of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks allege the two men plotted and participated in a plot to detonate a homemade homemade bomb inside a   apartment rented to the former Guantanamo Bay detainee. U. S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan in Manhattan issued the charges against    Muhammad Yunus, who escaped to Pakistan as a refugee from the Taliban, and his former employer, Omar Khudair, 22, who was held since Oct. 9, 2015, after being charged with one count of using the alias Abu Mohammed, according to the court documents. The charges relate to the alleged plot. ”Mr. Yunus was in direct contact with associates of Abu Mohammad and with the purported ’idea’ in the summer of 2014 that the U. S. could conduct bombing operations in their areas of production,” Sullivan said in a press release. The judge denied motions to dismiss the charges against Mr. Khudair and two other defendants in April, as well as a second motion filed last month to dismiss the charges. The first motion seeks a judge’s order against both defendants, in which a U. S. marshal would also be authorized to issue a restraining order, as Mr. Khudair’s attorneys argue they can’t afford to meet with his family this year. The    lawyer is suing by name, as is Mr. Khudair’s attorney, David Wegner. The court filing claims the allegations are ”against his own best interests and against his due rights.” See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → On Sept. 13 U. S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan issued a preliminary injunction that will see the two defendants convicted on two counts of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts relating to the   siege of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba, which President Obama has authorized in past weeks. Prosecutors contend the plot was carried out as part of an effort to increase money flowing to the Islamic State group. The\n",

            " it’s a   campaign.  But they should pay special attention to what they call the ”war on terror for whom it’s about as important.” “  is a pretty poor description of ”Americans.  If you don’t believe me, I hope you don’t read them. ” In an interview Sunday with ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Hillary Hillary Clinton accused of using the war on terror  —   which has been described as an international terrorism by Obama and others  —   to try to divide the country, the nation, family, and communities. Clinton said Obama was not trying to separate blacks from the crime wave or radical Islam, but rather that the U. S. was part of an “international plot” that involved an ”Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.” “If they aren’t going to see us as a nation, they have to see us as a community. ” She also suggested ISIS is now more “active than ever” and ”alliances formed across the Middle East are now stronger.” Trump’s response also came after the candidate repeatedly asserted on the campaign trail that the U. S. “military interventions” have killed millions who have been deemed dangerous. “We’ve been able to keep thousands of our troops in Iraq, and millions of others who had been around before ISIS came to the U. S. in the days leading up to George W. Bush,” he said in 2012. “It’s a very real threat. ” Trump has long been accused of failing to make peace between the two countries, and has vowed to do both. In his final day in the race last week, Hillary Clinton was quoted as saying “The war on terror is about to start. ” Yet some Republicans, including many from the party’s establishment, seem to be rallying behind Trump, considering it would put Republicans in a tough spot. “If he loses Florida, you’re going to see the worst of both worlds come crashing down,” a   former member of the House Judiciary Committee told ABC’s “Good Morning America. ”   \n",
            "    The Supreme Court on Monday declined to rule on a controversial case involving a law that would have kept New Hampshire’s new gun law under the current state law. President Obama’s court issued a brief statement late Monday saying ”There is nothing in our Constitution which prohibits anyone, not even a government employee, from carrying a   handgun in a public place.” At issue was an original ruling by the high court in 1994 and a case from the late 1960s that sought to keep a     license over an   handgun license. The Supreme Court rejected the state appeal two years later. The state challenged the ruling on the grounds that the   gun law “was not substantially constitutional,” and could not be enforced. Lawmakers also opposed the ruling. In a   decision Tuesday, the high court dismissed arguments that the law would have had a racial, social and other   effect, and cited a 2011 case in which three black students lost their cases against a predominantly white University of North Carolina School of Law in North Carolina, citing “racial discrimination. ” The court disagreed, ruling that the law does not require black students to obtain IDs as to who owns or transfers guns. ”It is apparent from our reading of the circumstances that race matters in the determination of a constitutional challenge to the   law. See,” said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, during an intercession. “We think race was a factor in the decision of the Supreme Court, and we have no basis in history to claim an exhaustive examination of the circumstances surrounding the ruling.” The appeals court case cited by the Supreme Court was Shelby v. Holder, which asked a federal district court to review whether a state law passed as a law under another state “could have had a racial effect on New Hampshire’s public handgun license and subsequent use. ” The panel rejected the state’s argument that the law would have a disparate impact on    because New Hampshire is a diverse state. Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted the need to make sure that New Hampshire’s law had good racial and psychological policy. She said New Hampshire has a “long tradition” of racially discriminatory practices in the United States. “This is a federal court decision,” said Justice Stephen G. Souter Jr. “We are extremely fortunate that the Supreme Court made the right decision,” said Gurbach, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. “We’re going to fight until the left comes clean about their hate crimes  —   but we need to get to the bottom of who committed\n",

            " A Texas woman accused of running afoul of a federal   law while in the U. S. is in a better condition than after being transferred from a detention facility, a federal judge in Dallas ordered Monday.   Jessica Hernandez, 19, was charged by a federal magistrate judge Monday in Texas with two counts of obstructing a federal officer and one count of felony perjury. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. She faces six months in federal prison. Her attorney has not yet responded to requests for comment about her condition or whereabouts. Her attorney on Monday declined to comment on whether she has a lawyer. Her lawyer on Monday afternoon also declined to comment on her injuries from the attacks. ”Jessica is in great shape,” Dallas Health and Human Services Secretary Liz Bowman wrote in an email. ”She’s been in and out of trauma centers and she is getting good     care in Texas.” A spokeswoman for Fort Meade County said it was ”honored and honored that Texas is prepared for a trial on the charge of obstructing a federal officer and one count of perjury.”\n",
            "  A senior lawmaker in Wisconsin said Monday that a former federal law enforcement officer who committed rape in a Washington mall sparked a national debate over policing for ”sexting” ”lunacy” because she was at work. “In some instances, people would get out of their jobs, or they would commit sexual violence,” Rep. Greg Walden,  . said in a statement. “It’s a sad reality that these acts of sexual violence against women and girls and their intimate relationships could happen at any time. ” Wisconsin state police are investigating for possible sexual violence against women and girls during the mall attack at the Cascade Mall in Olympia.   Federal law says ”any action by police to suppress and hinder the lawful conduct of a person or an assembly, or to withhold the consent of another, for a purpose other than as a remedy for a riot, insurrection, or insurrection, or to permit or in any case to facilitate the violation or in any case to interfere with the peace.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n",
            "  A California college student who vanished while hiking in California wilderness this past summer had a harrowing past ahead of her, friends said. Melissa Click, who disappeared while hiking in California in June 2015, reportedly was among several men who lured her to a wilderness area in southern California. Click was last seen on a trail around 9 a. m. June 20 when she went to sleep. ”The worst part about this investigation is that in trying to find her, we never know where she may be,” California State Police Lt. Brian Casseger told FoxNews. com. ”If you get there late and have to wait a day for your body to come back, that’s a major accomplishment. It’s a lot more important to find the boyfriend and date he’s been with, because if there’s a fight, then the police department, the state police and this individual may have committed sexual violence.” State police did not identify the individual. Click’s boyfriend, Tami Fitzgerald, was booked on a misdemeanor aggravated kidnapping charge last summer and has been jailed on   charges, authorities said in a release. FoxNews. com, citing a law enforcement source, reported Tuesday that law enforcement agencies around the state are investigating. The Associated Press reported Tuesday that investigators are interviewing ”several dozen” people, some of them college students, who may be part of the suspects’ families. Click was one of about 200 students from two college campuses who vanished last summer while hiking in California south of San Francisco and never turned up at school or was missing. Click, 29, had spent time in and around the area in the town of Alameda, about 100 miles to the south of San Francisco, between Oakland and San Jose.  Investigators have turned up no trace of her family and her last known address. The college town where Sheikah and Tessa have been missing has been closed since May, when investigators said Tessa went missing and was never located. The FBI is also investigating whether Fitzgerald may have been compromised and set up by the boyfriend, FoxNews. com reported last month, after the boyfriend gave investigators an email with information on where Tessa may have gone and the whereabouts of the pair, the report said. As part of the process of determining whom to look for, authorities are also looking into how Sheikah is identified and whether Tessa is connected to Fitzgerald.

            " aid. A spokesperson for the International Rescue Committee, which is helping evacuate the injured, told FoxNews. com that the plane came down about 8p. m. local time on Friday. ”The International Rescue Committee is in full contact right now and has a plan in place to evacuate patients in the   zone with all the aid,” a spokeswoman for the group told ABC. The spokesperson said the plane probably flew down in a pattern that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe or other European airports were likely to be in. ”There is also concern that if there had been any kind of   there could have been a fire,” the official said. ”This is a concern that the [interagency] contact has been in poor condition and we have to take some precautions to save people before they come out of the plane.” The latest disaster has already sent ripples throughout Europe: The aviation authority has already activated around 600 flights, and an international rescue team is set to deliver food and assistance to   areas along the route. ”What’s happened is a very sad reminder of the danger Europe today can be forced to navigate, and this was a very unfortunate scenario that shows the dire need for   protection,” said Paul Browne, a fellow at the International Crisis Group, or ICG. ”We’ve got the potential for very serious tragedies, and one day we may have lost the lives of 10, 000 people.” ”Civilians are not the main focus,” said Mark Jurgens, a European Council member for humanitarian issues. ”Civilians are the most vulnerable part of the situation.” According to the U. N.  Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Operations satellite imagery, the airspace over northern Syria as well as parts of the   Halab region (from the Turkish border and   of the Greek coast) are under attack from several types of militant groups. In the   SANA images, the area looks like it had struck a crossroads:   is the only   area that has not been completely reclaimed, with only the area under government control untouched.   Syrian government troops, supported by   air strikes, are poised to cut off the supply route from the   area. Meanwhile, the United Nations has warned that the violence plaguing the country poses a danger to peace efforts in the country. Earlier Saturday, the United Nations imposed a punishing closure on a rebel enclave inside Syria’s northern city of Aleppo that stands largely immune to the onslaught of militants. The closure forced evacuations of residents and the seizure of aid convoys. With the closure looming, evacuees were ordered back into the city after nearly six hours of sustained fighting. Aid groups are estimating that at least 500, 000 Syrians remain in Aleppo. The closure comes as several Syrian government forces withdrew amid their fight back in the northern province of Palmyra on Thursday, the country’s civil protection service said. The Syrian Observatory of War and   Syria group said on Sunday that the heavy bombardment by rebels and government forces had killed more than 150, 000 people, including a senior rebel official and hundreds of civilians trapped with high explosives. It was unclear further who was responsible for   residents in the northern city of Aleppo.\n",
            "    The Syrian army declared victory over the jihadist group Wednesday as it launched its heaviest offensive yet against the Islamic State terror group in the country’s north and west while also advancing in the country’s   province and on its northern   border. The military said up to 500, 000 fighters had retaken almost all of Syria and were moving back to the country’s   heartland, where scores of rebel factions are engaged in fierce battles. ”The army has achieved   gains, advancing significantly,” Gen.      Brig. Gen. Mohammed   Assad told reporters at a conference of foreign ministers in Baghdad. ”We expect a lot from the army. We expect it to gain strength. The army is the great guarantor of freedom and stability in Syria,” he said, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State. The army was formed following   battles in all   cities in the country, he said. The victories came as the army was moving on. On May 31, the army defeated the Islamic State group in the northern Syria city of Palmyra.   Syrian and foreign media also say the army led by President Bashar   is preparing to take the city. Meanwhile, some 1, 700 civilians and 3, 200 government troops were set to leave    Syria for places    last weekend. The Syrian army said it would send the army’s aviation wing to take the remaining Syrian military members out of Palmyra and deliver them to the     government. And it added that the army’s aircraft carrier would return to its   island in the area\n",
