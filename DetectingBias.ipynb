            " a national investigation.” She also called for Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. ”I am calling for legislative action to repeal, replace, and replace ObamaCare,” she said, adding, ”The Republicans want repeal.” Sanders’ call came in the aftermath of an election that seemed to show confidence in his supporters.  Clinton had been the focus of Clinton’s campaign, which has relied heavily on social media to keep Clinton connected to the public, but her team has been quick to capitalize on the storm. The Clinton campaign responded with a video saying it was ”not interested in” Clinton’s private email server. The video was retweeted hundreds of times on social media.  Last week, Clinton was seen on a plane bound for Miami, in what seemed an attempt to smooth out her loss in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Republican Donald Trump.  ”This election is not over or even close and we are still in the process of evaluating a number of options that will ensure the continued success of her campaign and, hopefully, the Democrats in doing all of this,” Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told ABC News earlier this month.  Trump has vowed to release his tax returns before the November ballot, but aides have suggested the party cannot release its own returns.  This week, Clinton was seen holding a rally in New York, but she has been in Wisconsin, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia, and New Jersey.  Clinton is likely to win all of Iowa, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania.  Trump has been in Arizona this election cycle for the weekend.  It’s unclear what the Democratic candidate, if any, will do in Pennsylvania,  but a New York Times report said that Trump has ”thrilled” about the state.  She even took a selfie with some of her supporters on Saturday, raising a fist in the air as she returned to New York to attend a   rally.   The Democrat candidate said in a letter to her supporters: ”I am so proud to be a part of this campaign that many people across the country are calling for.” That message is echoed in a blistering speech by Bill Clinton on Saturday that went down without a hitch.  The Clinton campaign says that the speech is in the national interest and a Clinton victory would only create another round of voter intimidation that could have a devastating impact on Clinton’s poll numbers.  Clinton was booed at a rally in Philadelphia in response.  After Clinton’s speech, she tweeted out, ”Thank you Bill, I’m sure you’ll vote for Hillary Clinton’s victory tonight.”  In New York City, Trump tweeted that his wife and former first lady were on a ”brief” trip to the state. Trump was not alone.  Democratic pollsters had previously warned a Trump victory would be difficult.  One recent poll put Clinton ahead last week of Trump.  It appeared that the former secretary of state’s performance was not quite on point.  Still, Clinton, who defeated Trump in a New York City contest, took the stage, in a    style, to talk about the challenges of the 2016 election.  ”We still have our work to do,” Clinton said during a Monday night interview with CNN. ”We still have to get our act together. And we gotta get our party together.”  Her campaign said Clinton would speak at a state event.  Trump has made his campaign more aggressive toward supporters of the Republican candidate, and some advisers suggested the billionaire would not shy away from getting nasty with New York voters with a message on the campaign trail.

See Latest Coverage → “For the people of New York, that’s a good thing to bring up as well,” Trump said on NBC’s “Meet the Press. It’s the one thing I need,” he added.   Clinton was on “The Late Show,” and her husband’s  ”Fox and Friends” show gave Trump a warm welcome    appearing alongside Donald Trump  . When she and her husband won the presidency last fall, Trump was booed.  At the time, Clinton had been widely criticized for not making enough of a dent in her support, and she had been praised repeatedly for supporting the GOP Party.     <endoftext>\n",

            "[CONTENT]  Officials with the National Security Agency (NSA) made an apparent public announcement Sunday that the data they collected after the Orlando nightclub tragedy was not in fact part of the search warrant that sparked a deadly series of terror attacks. The latest “Havoc”   which was discovered by the FBI, shows an alleged   plot by an   Muslim man, reportedly from the city of Paris, that included the capture of several gay nightclub patrons as well as the detonation of a bomb. ”It’s not like a ’Havoc’ we’ve never seen before,” the NSA told The Associated Press in an official statement. ”There is no evidence at all that we conducted any other analysis of the metadata on anyone.” The FBI did not confirm or deny reports about the plot against the gay nightclub patrons, but the FBI statement also noted that the terror plots, while potentially connected to the Orlando terror attack, remain in question.  The New York Times reported last week that the FBI, after   analysis of metadata by a security firm dubbed “Heartbleed,” found ”nothing at all” to link the Pulse nightclub shooter to terrorism.  Heartbleed, which specializes in securing encryption keys for computers used by terrorist suspects, has been cited for decades for securing phone records and other data. NSA Director Michael Flynn told “Fox  Friends” on Sunday that no government could ever track the location of a phone. He suggested that may be the reason the agency is not able to fully understand the scope. The latest terror attack by an Islamic extremist is the worst terror attack of the year since 9/11, the Times noted last October, during the aftermath of ISIS’ suicide bombing attack in San Bernardino, California. While a separate ISIS suicide bombing carried out by al Abadi killed 14 and injured dozens in 2013 killed 53, it was the worst terrorist attack on U. S. soil since World War II, the New York Times noted in its story on Tuesday. The Times reported earlier this year that NSA analysts found the metadata on phones used by ISIS sympathisers in Britain and Canada as well as the terrorist group’s online messaging and voice calls used to commit   attacks, as well as metadata indicating what terrorist groups and individuals could be communicating through those devices.  The FBI told FoxNews. com that the metadata could be linked to the recent Las Vegas terror attack. While the investigation could not find links to Orlando, a similar threat occurred in 2014, when another gay nightclub shooter, Micah Xavier Johnson, blew himself up using an encryption key that was used on his phone. The FBI did not find any conclusive evidence linking the Pulse nightclub shooter to Pulse.  A similar plot against Pulse took place in 2012, when more than 100 people were killed there. The FBI did not find evidence that would link Orlando’s Pulse bomb plot to the shooting in the club, but it did confirm that “Heartbleed,” an NSA company known for its encryption equipment, had been used by the terrorist. The latest edition of “Havoc: ”” was released Monday. The FBI’s ‘Havoc’ said the terrorist plot “was unrelated to Pulse, but unrelated to any of the incidents in Pulse. ” Heartbleed is considered a key to secure an encrypted data connection.    <endoftext>\n",
